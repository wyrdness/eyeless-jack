## Overview

Eyeless Jack is a **fictional character** from internet creepypasta stories, typically depicted as a figure in a black hoodie with empty, tar-dripping eye sockets who breaks into homes at night to harvest human organs—particularly kidneys—which he eats. The character emerged around 2012 on creepypasta forums and has become part of the "creepypasta canon" alongside Slenderman, Jeff the Killer, and others.

**THIS IS FICTION**. Eyeless Jack is a created character for horror stories, not a real entity. The original story describes a college student who underwent a supernatural transformation through a cult ritual, losing his eyes and gaining cannibalistic urges. Various versions and stories exist, but all are creative fiction.

Like many creepypasta entities, Eyeless Jack exists in a liminal space where some people claim "belief" or "sightings," but these represent the phenomenon of fiction inspiring belief rather than evidence of a real entity. The character has inspired fan art, games, and merchandise.
